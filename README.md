# Mushrooms4All
Data science project to make predictions about new types of mushrooms. Subject: Cognitive Systems. Programme: Master's degree in Data Science.

This application applies a pretrained model to the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/ymotonskillupai/mushroomscsv and returns edible or not edible as a result.

Since the models were deployed in Microsoft azure, the prediction part of the app is not working anymore.

You can use the dashboard to view the functionalities as well as the visualization of the dataset.
